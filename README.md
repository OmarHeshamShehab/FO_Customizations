### OHMS Service Integration

A **custom service module** built under the **OHMS model**, providing an example of a secure, extensible integration pattern for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations (D365FO).

#### ðŸ“¦ Components
- **ohmsRequest** â€” Input contract containing the `dataAreaId` (target legal entity).  
- **ohmsResponse** â€” Output contract containing `Success`, `ErrorMessage`, and `DebugMessage` values.  
- **ohmsService** â€” Core service logic class implementing a `Create` operation that executes within a specific company context.

#### ðŸ§  Key Highlights
- Implements best-practice service patterns using **[DataContract]** and **[DataMember]** attributes.
- Uses `changecompany` for context-specific execution.
- Handles both **CLR** and **X++ exceptions** safely.
- Demonstrates correct use of `InteropPermission` for .NET interop calls.
- Returns standardized response objects for integrations and API consumers.

#### ðŸ§° Deployment & Setup
1. Create a **service** named `ohmsService` and assign the `ohmsService` class.  
2. Add the `Create` method to the service.  
3. Create a **service group** named `ohmsServiceGroup` and include the service.  
4. Set `Auto Deploy = Yes` and synchronize the model.

#### ðŸ”¬ Testing (Postman)
Use a `POST` request to:
```
https://usnconeboxax1aos.cloud.onebox.dynamics.com/api/services/ohmsServiceGroup/ohmsService/Create
```

**Body:**
```json
{
    "_request": {
        "dataAreaId": "usmf"
    }
}
```

**Headers:**
| Key | Value |
|-----|--------|
| Content-Type | application/json |
| Authorization | Bearer <your-access-token> |

**Sample Response:**
```json
{
    "Success": "true",
    "ErrorMessage": "",
    "debugMessage": "Hello World from usmf"
}
```

## Development Guidelines

These guidelines ensure consistency, quality, and maintainability of customizations:

- Use the **Chain of Command (CoC)** for extending existing logic.
- Keep customizations **upgrade-safe** by avoiding overlayering and following best practices.
- Document all customizations and extensions thoroughly.

---

## Testing & Verification

To ensure the customizations work as intended:

- Follow the testing steps outlined in each moduleâ€™s documentation.
- Verify data synchronization and integration points, especially for Commerce-related customizations.
- Validate that CoC implementations do not break standard functionality and are upgrade-safe.
